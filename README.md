# slim-person-page

Inspired by FamilySearch's person page https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/{PID}

I wanted to see if I could recreate the same look of the page without making nearly as many network requests.

This project is intended to demo how many requests are actually needed to paint the page.
This is not intended to be feature complete or production ready.

In this basic app, the pid and sessionId will be passed in as query params.
URLs are hard coded to beta so you'll need to generate your own beta sessionid and find a valid PID.
http://localhost:8080/?pid={pid}&sessionId={sessionId}
